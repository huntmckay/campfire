study for 25 minutes take 5 minutes off

Before the first 25 minutes:

1. Declutter your workspace.
1. Block distractions.
1. Set a fixed place and time to learn daily.
1. Clear your mind after practicing.
1. Engage with the community to stay accountable.
1. Write and print your learning plan.

Study undistracted for 25 minutes, no phones, music, tv, beds, etc
Take a deliberate 5 minutes to relax, call a friend, watch a video, listen to music

This process is sustainable for hours and keeps focus.
