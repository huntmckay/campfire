# How to Script

'Script' Definition:

logical sequence of steps of a simple program. Typically a plain-text file

Scripts are formated in such a way that a specific "interpreter" can "____"

Scripts are typically handmade by users, and executed by users, or scheduled. 

My rule of thumb used to be "if you have to more then 3 times, write a script and automate it"

Now I take the time to understand my problem and think "can I automate this?" the answer is nearly always yes, but the limiting factor is I am not good enough yet. We get good by forcing ourselves to do it.


# OUT OF SCOPE:

- Modules are typically meant to be imported to aid the user in doing something a bit easier. 
- Breakpoints and debuggers

# Syntax Vs Semantics 

The syntax of a programming language describes which strings of of characters comprise a valid program. The semantics of a programming language describes what syntactically valid programs mean, what they do. In the larger world of linguistics, syntax is about the form of language, semantics about meaning.

Python is often refered to as a Programming language, but it is also the name of the interepter. 

An interpreted language needs a piece of software between the user and the computer that will convert the high-level code into something more useable by the computer. An interpreter can be written in C, Java, Python or .NET (we wont go deep into this).

With the python interpreter there are two ways to execute code:
1. As a script or module
2. Directly run in the interpreter prompt

## Tutorial 1 python scripting 

vim hello.py

## Tutorial 2 python interpreter

1. open a shell and type `python3`
```powershell
PS C:\Projects\campfire> python.exe
Python 3.10.10 (tags/v3.10.10:aad5f6a, Feb  7 2023, 17:20:36) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
